# Lytelove-opencode
The basis for my lytelove chatsim code, no story other than filler text for certain features to show up.


I'll leave the code fully commented, but please feel free to use or modify this for the chatsim jam! Do not modify to resell, but feel free to use it as a reference or even steal mini snippets for your own code. Also just give me a lil credit!


# What this project includes:

* A functional MP3 Player that is draggable and hideable on screen
* a task bar inspired quick menu at the bottom
* a gallery screen (that is definitely still a template from lemmasoft that i never used)
* custom icons and text chat colors for your player
* a custom 'mini profile' that displays in the bottomleft with an updating icon and username.
* nvl based chat system
* probably other things im forgetting

Im horrible at writing descriptions, so please feel free to look at all the code files!

WARNING: 90 % of my ui is image buttons. Idk how to use anything else and make it look cute, sue me.
